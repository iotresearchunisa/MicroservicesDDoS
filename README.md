# A Benchmark for DDoS Attacks Detection in Microservice Architectures

The prevalence of microservice architectures in contemporary software development is increasing due to their capacity for scalability and flexibility. However, this architectural style presents several security challenges, particularly in the identification and mitigation of cyber attacks. This paper presents different datasets designed to serve as a benchmark for the evaluation of attack detection strategies for microservice applications. The datasets contains both normal and malicious traffic patterns. The data were collected from widely used benchmark microservice systems, which interacted with various services via standard protocols and application programming interface (API) gateways. Each entry is marked to distinguish between benign and malicious activities. In addition to the raw data, the datasets also contains metadata detailing microservice configurations, the nature of the simulated attacks, and the time sequence of events. The provision of these datasets is intended to facilitate the development of advanced detection algorithms and promote more effective security measures in microservice environments.
